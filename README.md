=====

This is designed to be a utility module that provides simplified helpers for useful pythonic tasks. This currently includes:
- mplogging - A module that provides an easy queue based method for multiprocessor safe logging
- archives - A module that wraps zipfile and tarfile modules with common method signatures. This also provides native archive file handling if implemented (uses unzip/tar on unix machines) and also facilitates the complete in-memory processing of an archive file.
- checksum - A helper module to handle fingerprinting of in-memory and on-disk objects dynamically.
- download - A module that acts as a multiprocess aware download manager that can handle both async/blocking download requests.

This project is currently being incubated at https://github.com/abn/jsnoop
